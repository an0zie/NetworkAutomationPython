As  a Student Network Engineer, I want to automatically generate router interface configuration commands, so I can avoid manual typing errors and save time when configuring Cisco devices.

As a  Student Network Engineer, I want to automatically   generate SSH setup commands, so I can securely access  routers remotely using authenticated login.

As a Student Network Engineer, I want to build and test a Packet Tracer network using Cisco 2911 routers and 3560 Mulitlayer switches , 2960 switches, Servers and PCs so I can simulate a real enterprise environment.

As a Student Network Engineer, I want to verify connectivity between PCs, routers, and switches, so I can confirm that the generated configurations are correct and functional.


As a Student, I want the automation script to output clean and readable configuration blocks, so I can easily copy and paste them into Packet Tracer routers.

As a Student, I want to troubleshoot any issues with the script or devices, so I can learn how automation affects real network setups.

As a Student, I want to run the script repeatedly with different inputs, so I can generate configurations for multiple routers without rewriting commands manually.


Acceptance criteria:

(auto-generate router configuration)
- The script asks for hostname, interface, IP address, and subnet mask.
- The script generates a valid IOS configuration block containing hostname, interface settings, ip address, and no shutdown.
- The router accepts the commands without errors.

(auto-generate SSH configuration)
- The script outputs commands for domain name, RSA key generation, username, password, and VTY SSH settings.
- SSH login succeeds from a PC using “ssh -l user 192.168.x.x”.

(test connectivity)
- PC can ping router interfaces successfully.
- SSH login using script credentials works.
- Configuration is saved with “write memory”.

(build Packet Tracer topology)
- Devices are connected correctly with copper straight-through cables.
- Network Device interfaces show green link lights.
- PCs can ping router interfaces.
