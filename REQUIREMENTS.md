## INTRODUCTION
IN THIS SECTION WE DEFINE THE PROJECTS REQUIREMENTS,USER STORIES AND USE CASES THAT GUIDE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE NETWORK AUTOMATION SYSTEM USING PYTHON
THE AIM IS TO ENSURE ALL USER EXPECTATIONAND SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY IS CLEARLY DEFINED 

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
**1. Configuratuion Generator**:Here this system should be able to generate valid Cisco IOS configurations automatically based on the the user's inputs 

**2. SSH Configuration Block**:Here the systemshould be able to generate secure SSH setup commands for routers and switches 

**3. Interface IP Assignment**: The user should be able to specify interface names,IP Addresses and Subnet Masks 

**4. CLI OUTPUT DISPLAY**: Here the generated configurations should be displayed clearly for easy copy-and-paste into the Packet Tracer Network Devices.

**5. INPUT VALIDATION** : The system should be able to validate input formats to prevent configuration errors ( for example . in IP Addresses)

## NON-FUNCTION REQUIREMENT

**1. Performance**:Script execution  should be completed in very little time (preferably less than 5 seconds )
**2. Portability**: The program should run on any Windows  system with Python 3.12 and Above.
**3. Reliability** :The generated configuration must execute correctly on all Cisco Network Devices (Cisco 2911 Routers , Cisco 3560 Mulilayer Switch).

## SUMMARY
THE REQUIREMENTS ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT FULFILL THE OBJECTIVES LISTED OUT
