## Introduction
Here we are going to explain some of the protocols , background concepts and terms 
that will form the foundation of this project .

## Network Automation 
This refers to the process of using software tools and processes to design, configure,
manage network infrastructure and test network devices automatically eliminating the need of manually enter the configuration scripts as network automation is far more efficient

## Programming Language 
The most preferrable and efficient programming  language needed for this project(automating networks) will be Python .
Libraries such as **Netmiko**, **Paramiko** and **NAPALM** allow engineers to connect to routers and switches using Secure Shell(SSH) and execute commands programmatically.

## SSH (Secure Shell)
This is a secure protocol  used for remote management of network devices as it enables tunneling 
in this project we will be using it for system administartion as it will manage servers,routers and multilayers switches

## IOS Configuration(Cisco)
This is the command line interface (CLI) used for Routers , Switches and other network devices   used when configuration teask are performed
In this project we will be using CISCO manufactured Routers , switches and other network devices 

## SUMMARY 
We need existing technologies such as  Python and SSH to achieve automated configuration generation and network device management.
